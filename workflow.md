# Better Workflow Practices
The simple solution to prevent this merge conflict would be clear communication between group members. Clearly the two
hypothetical developers here had completely opposite ideas for the direction of the project. If they had organised their work better, their
work would not have **a:** overlapped to this extent, nullifying one dev's work or **b:** been entirely contradictory, also nullifying one dev's work. Ideally the two would have added seperate ingredients or changed different parts of the burger, but the mismanagement present in this
scenario prevented everyone from working more effectively
